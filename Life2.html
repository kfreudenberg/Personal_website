   <p> Since a young age, Kyle has enjoyed playing soccer. Originally drawn to the sport because her girl scout troop began playing,
Kyle has development many friendships through the sport. She was captain of her high school varsity team, but the first game of the season
Kyle tore her ACL. Fortunately Kyle has continued playing soccer in college, joining The George Washington University Women's Club Soccer Team. <p>
